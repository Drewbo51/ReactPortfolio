# ReactPortfolio

1. Welcome to my portfolio, I used React to create what you see here and even utilized React-Router-Dom
to create a multi-faceted site that doesn't require additional loading to navigate between links.

2. There is a tab you can use to contact me, rather it be through social media or even my e-mail. Feel 
free to navigate to the projects tab as well where you can see some of my coding successes.
